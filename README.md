# VNRServer

Welcome to **VNRServer**

This is a server template with:

Frontend: **V** ue.js + Webpack +

Backend: **N** ode.js + Express.js +

Database: **R** ethinkDB

This is a prototype of how we're gonna build servers,
in the future we can also use only partials of this project.
For instance using the Backend setup of this project but using React.js for frontend.

---

## How to start the servers:

I'm not sure how to yet, probably:
```
npm run dev;
```
```
node app.js;
```
here's a [link](www.google.com) to the reference

---

## Notes:

here's how I got to this point for this project:

1. install node.js, install yarn
```
brew install yarn
```
2. install vue client
```
npm install -g vue-cli
```
3. setup webpack project with folder name vue
```
vue init webpack vue
```
4. ask vue init to run yarn init or npm init, or run it yourself
```
yarn init
```
